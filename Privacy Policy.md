# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** March 7, 2025
**Last Updated:** May 12, 2025

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how GreatBot "the Bot" operates with your Discord server and personal information. We built this bot with privacy as a core principle, which means we deliberately avoid collecting your data.

## What We Don't Collect

GreatBot is designed to be completely privacy-friendly. We do not collect, store, process, monitor, or retain any of the following:

**Personal Information:**
- Usernames, display names, or Discord user IDs
- Email addresses or contact information
- Profile pictures, avatars, or custom status messages
- Personal details from user profiles or bios

**Message and Communication Data:**
- Message content from any channels or direct messages
- Command inputs or parameters you provide
- Conversation history or chat logs
- Voice communications or audio data
- Files, images, videos, or other media shared in channels

**Server and Community Data:**
- Server names, descriptions, or settings
- Channel names, topics, or configurations
- Member lists or role assignments
- Server activity patterns or usage statistics
- Moderation actions or administrative decisions

**Technical and Usage Information:**
- IP addresses or network information
- Device specifications, browser types, or operating systems
- Location data or geographic information
- Usage analytics, metrics, or behavioral tracking
- Error logs or diagnostic information beyond immediate troubleshooting

## How GreatBot Actually Works

The Bot operates using real-time processing without any persistent data storage infrastructure. When you use commands like `/qr`, `/weather`, or `/password`, the Bot processes your request instantly and discards all information immediately after delivering the response.

**Command Processing:**
- Commands are processed in temporary memory only
- No logs are created of who used which commands
- Input parameters are processed and immediately forgotten
- Response data is generated fresh for each request without storing previous interactions

**Server Integration:**
- The Bot responds to commands in real-time without maintaining server state
- No databases or storage systems retain information about your server or its members
- All processing happens ephemerally within Discord's infrastructure

## Third-Party Services and APIs

For certain functionality, GreatBot may temporarily query external services (such as weather APIs for the `/weather` command). However:
- We do not share your personal information with these services
- These interactions are anonymous and temporary
- No user-identifiable data is transmitted to external providers
- The Bot acts as an intermediary without storing or logging these interactions

## Data Security and Architecture

Since GreatBot doesn't collect personal information, traditional data security concerns don't apply. Our architecture is designed around the principle of data minimization:
- No user databases or storage systems exist
- No backup or archival systems contain personal information
- No data transmission occurs between our systems and external storage
- All interactions are stateless and temporary

## User Control and Rights

You maintain complete control over your interactions with GreatBot:
- You can stop using the Bot's commands at any time
- Server administrators can remove the Bot from servers without any data concerns
- No personal information exists to access, modify, export, or delete
- Your Discord privacy settings control what information the Bot can temporarily access during command processing

## Compliance with Privacy Regulations

GreatBot's no-data-collection design ensures compliance with major privacy regulations:
- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):** No personal data processing occurs
- **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act):** No personal information is collected or sold
- **COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act):** Safe for all age groups due to zero data collection
- **International Privacy Laws:** Minimal compliance burden due to privacy-by-design architecture

## Service Reliability and Availability

GreatBot provides utility commands and entertainment features without requiring user data collection:
- Weather information, QR code generation, and other utilities work through anonymous API calls
- Fun commands like jokes and games operate using pre-programmed content
- Server management features use Discord's built-in permissions without additional data storage

## Transparency and Open Source

We believe in complete transparency about GreatBot's operations:
- Our privacy practices can be verified through code review
- The Bot's functionality is straightforward and documented
- We welcome security researchers and privacy advocates to examine our practices
- Any questions about our data handling can be answered definitively: we simply don't handle personal data

## Updates and Changes

If GreatBot's functionality ever changes to include data collection, we will:
- Update this Privacy Policy with clear notice of what data would be collected and why
- Provide advance notice to users through appropriate channels
- Ensure any new data collection practices comply with applicable privacy laws
- Continue to maintain our commitment to user privacy and transparency
